My name is David Seah. I am currently working as a Software Engineer doing R&D in computer graphics.  
I studied in Digipen Institute of Technology and that was when I first touch graphics programming. 
I am always like graphical stuff and challenges, doing graphics seems like the perfect combination. 
Vulkan just offically launch early this year and of course I will be interested to learn it too. 
And what better way to learn it than to write about it.
