My name is David Seah. I am from Singapore working as a Software Engineer in the automotive industry. 
I first learned programming when I was 17 years old but didn't really like it. I was more into graphics design then. 

However after my national service (mandatory in Singapore), by some chance I found myself a job in a startup working on iPhone application. 
That was the year 2009 where the gold rush for iPhone development just started. That was where I found myself getting interested in programming. 

After working around one and a half year in the startup. I found the need to upgrade my skills. I enrolled and got into Digipen Insititue of Technology Singapore. 
This is where I first got into graphics programming. Having a passion for graphical stuff, graphics programming came naturally for me. 
Digipen Insititue of Technology is well known for its computer graphics courses, because of that I have learn alot of computer graphics. 

In school, we also have many projects where we are required to build games, I will always volunteer to be the graphics programmer. 
As a result I learned how to build graphics engine, it was alot of trial and error. Days and Nights of debugging. 
I remember once it took me one month to debug a skeleton animation bug, there was a bug in our team mathematics library. 

Since graduation, I found myself naturally wanting to work with graphics programming and I was forutune enought to get a job doing R&D in graphics.
Just early this year, Khronous announce a new graphics API. Naturally I am interested to learn it too. What better way to learn it than to write about it right?
I know that there are already website out there that teaches Vulkan. But I am treating this as a learning experience as well as hopefully help someone out there too.
