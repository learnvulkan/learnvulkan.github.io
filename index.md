## Introduction
So what is Vulkan? If you have not already read about it. 
Vulkan is the spirtual successor of OpenGL, although OpenGL will be still co exist together with it. Khrono members from all different graphics industry comes together to agreee that there is a need for a new generation cross platform GPU API.
After many months of hard work from many working groups, in February 16 2016, Vulkan 1.0 was release. 

Vulkan was design to give direct and low level control of the GPU.
With simpler and thinner driver, application will have more direct control of memory allocaton and thread creation of command buffers with Multi queue work submission.

So what is the differences between Trditional graphics driver like OpenGL and low level API like Vulkan? 
Traditional graphics drivers are easy to use. You just have to tell OpenGL what you want it to do and the driver will do the job for you. 
However in low level API, the application has to handle most of the stuff, you know what you write will be what you get. 
However this also means that you have to write more code and do more work. 



### Prerequisites
I will attempt to explain things as simple as possible. 
However pre exisiting knowledge of C++ will be needed. 
It will be good to have a background in computer graphics and OpenGL or any other graphics API.
